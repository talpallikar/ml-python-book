Introductory Notes

- Three types: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement
- ML grew out of AI
- Useful for making sense of structured and unstructured data

I. Supervised Learning

- Seeks to learn a mdoel from labeled training data to make predictions about unseen or future data.

- Can be discrete (classification) OR continuous (regression)

    A. Classification: 
        Goal is to predict categorical class labels of new instances based on past observations. 

        Example: email spam detection is a binary classification task - the algorithm learns rules to distinguish b/w two classes: spam and not spam. 

        You can have nonbinary (multi-class) classification tasks - handwriteen character recognition is an example. 

    B. Regression: 
       We have a predictor and a response variable, and we try to find the relationship between the two. 

II. Reinforcement Learning

    Develop an agent that improves performances based on interactions with environemnt. 

III. Unsupervised Learning

    We don't know the right answer (data is of an unknown structure)

    A. Clustering:
        Create clusters without knowing group memberships (like an unsupervised classification) 

    B. Dimensionality reduction for data compression
        Used for feature preproccessing to improve predictive performance of algos and compress data 
        Also used for visualization of data 

NOTATION

- Samples are rows and features are columns - Iris is a 150x4 matrix
